## üë®‚Äçüíª About the Author

Hey! My name is  [Fran√ßois](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fporcher/), I am a A.I Research Scientist at Meta. Previously I was doing research on Deep Learning and NeuroImaging at Cambridge University, and I graduated from UC Berkeley and CentraleSupelec.

Being very curious and constantly learning, I have a very broad range of interests. I also like to break down the most complex topics into the tiniest bits and explain them in a simple way.

This is why I decided to distill all this knowledge into a series of articles/tutorials that I hope you will find useful.

Enjoy! ü§ó
