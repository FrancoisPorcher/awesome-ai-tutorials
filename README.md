# ðŸ˜Ž Awesome AI Tutorials

Welcome to this AWESOME repository of AI Tutorials!

This is a collection of tutorials I have made on various aspects of Artificial Intelligence (AI). I dig deep into subjects and you will information that you find nowhere else.
Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced AI enthusiast, these tutorials will provide you with valuable insights and practical knowledge and enable you to upskill in Computer Vision, NLP, Uncertainty Prediction, MLOps, Cloud Computing and more.

You can find a list of my articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@foporcher).

## About the Author

Hi! My name is FranÃ§ois. I am an incoming Research Scientist at Meta AI in the Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research lab (FAIR). I am currently a visiting Researcher at Cambridge University, trying to improve the state of the art in 3D Image Segmentation. Prior to that I graduated from UC Berkeley and CentraleSupelec, majoring in Computer Sciences and Applied Mathematics.

Being extremely curious by nature, I naturally explore a lot of different ideas, articles, classes, books, and I thought it would be great to distill all this knowledge into useful Medium articles and Github repositories for you.

Feel free to reach out! You can also recommend me a tutorial on a theme you would like to see.
