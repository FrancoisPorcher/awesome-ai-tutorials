## 👨‍💻 About the Author

Hey! My name is [François](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fporcher/), I am a A.I Research Scientist at Meta. Previously I was also doing research in Computer vision and LLMs at Stanford University and Cambridge University.

Being very curious and constantly learning, I have a very broad range of interests. I also like to break down the most complex topics into the tiniest bits and explain them in a simple way.

This is why I decided to distill all this knowledge into a series of articles/tutorials that I hope you will find useful.

Enjoy! 🤗
