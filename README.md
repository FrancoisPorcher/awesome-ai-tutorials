## About the Author

Hi! My name is FranÃ§ois. I am an incoming Research Scientist at Meta AI in the Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research lab (FAIR). I am currently a visiting Researcher at Cambridge University, trying to improve the state of the art in 3D Image Segmentation. Prior to that I graduated from UC Berkeley and CentraleSupelec, majoring in Computer Sciences and Applied Mathematics.

Being extremely curious by nature, I naturally explore a lot of different ideas, articles, classes, books, and I thought it would be great to distill all this knowledge into useful Medium articles and Github repositories for you.

Feel free to reach out! You can also recommend me a tutorial on a theme you would like to see.
